As a proud NVIDIA Shield owner, I’ve connected multiple hard drives to my device — one for extra internal storage, and a larger external USB drive that I can also plug into other PCs when needed. I wanted a simple way to delete or move multiple movies and TV shows between these drives, especially from internal to external storage, And after moving files, I often needed to trigger additional tasks — like refreshing my (plex) media library.

That’s why I created Batch-Man.

Batch-Man is a batch file manager plugin for Kodi. It lets you quickly select and batch-move or delete movies and TV shows between internal and external storage. You can even run a custom command automatically after each batch operation — perfect for tasks like updating Plex or library tasks
